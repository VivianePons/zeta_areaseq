This code is an annex to the paper

A description of the Zeta map on Dyck paths area sequences by Viviane Pons [arXiv:2205.06375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06375), 2022.

We provide implementations of all combinatorial statistics and maps described in the paper as well as a demo notebook following the same structure as the paper.

You can run the demo notebook directly on the web without any installation by [clicking on this binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/zeta_areaseq/main).
